# UPDATED: 01:38:43 UTC Monday, January 29, 2024
# THIS PROJECT IS UNDER CONSTANT DEVELOPMENT!
# NEW FEATURE - Base64 encoding.
# rMETAshell is an innovative tool designed for shell command metadata injection and dynamic one-liner generation.
# rMETAshell takes a shell command and an image, video or text file as input. It then injects the command into the file using metadata comments. After injection, it generates a one-liner execution method for retrieving and executing the injected command from a remote location.

# FEATURED ON [LINUXHUNTERS.COM](https://www.linuxhunters.com/) Jan 13, 2024 ARTICLE!
