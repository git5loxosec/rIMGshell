# rMETAshell
## MAJOR UPDATE: 01:38:43 UTC Monday, January 29, 2024
## rMETAshell is a versatile command-line tool designed to inject commands into media and text files, facilitating the creation of one-liner execution methods for various file formats. It offers an easy way to embed commands such as reverse shells or custom scripts into files like [pictures](https://github.com/git5loxosec/rMETAshell/blob/main/README.md#rmetashell-is-a-versatile-command-line-tool-designed-to-inject-commands-into-media-and-text-files-facilitating-the-creation-of-one-liner-execution-methods-for-various-file-formats-it-offers-an-easy-way-to-embed-commands-such-as-reverse-shells-or-custom-scripts-into-files-like-pictures-or-videos-which-can-then-be-used-for-various-purposes-including-security-testing-and-penetration-testing) or [videos](https://github.com/git5loxosec/rMETAshell/blob/main/README.md#rmetashell-is-a-versatile-command-line-tool-designed-to-inject-commands-into-media-and-text-files-facilitating-the-creation-of-one-liner-execution-methods-for-various-file-formats-it-offers-an-easy-way-to-embed-commands-such-as-reverse-shells-or-custom-scripts-into-files-like-pictures-or-videos-which-can-then-be-used-for-various-purposes-including-security-testing-and-penetration-testing), which can then be used for various purposes, including security testing and penetration testing.
